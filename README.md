# Library
A simple JavaScript Library app to learn OOP, Objects and Object Constructors.

Assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

### Things I Learned: 
- Accepting HTML Form data
- Using the ```FormData``` object 
- Form Data validation (No input sanitization)
- Spread syntax (...), specifically for function calls with Object Constructors
- ```localeStorage``` and preforming CRUD operations on items with it during runtime
- Checking localStorage for user data on page load
- ```Object.prototype``` and creating prototype methods
- Prototypal Inheritance 

### Functionality:
- User can store: A collection of the books
- The book data includes: Title, Author, Page Count and if it has been read or not
- User can remove a book at any time, which will also update it in local storage
- User can toggle local storage on or off and not lose functionality
- Dynamically update a books 'Read' status, which is reflected in local storage as well
